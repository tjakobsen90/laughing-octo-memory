A struct is a precursor to an object. The struct and its elements are all in the same chunk of RAM.
A structure is a collection of other data types (variables) that are stored in one block of memory where you can access each variable independently by name.

Pointer:
ptr->elem   Use ptr to struct/union to get elem

Malloc: memory allocator, it saves a bit of RAM for later use.
